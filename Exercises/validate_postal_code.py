# Validate Postal Code (Canadian)

"""

Define a function postalValidate(S) which first checks if S represents
a postal code (Canadian) which is valid:

    first, delete all spaces;
    the remainder must be of the form L#L#L# where L are letters
    (in either lower or upper case) and # are numbers.
    
If S is not a valid postal code, return the boolean False.
If S is valid, return a version of the same postal code in the nice format
L#L#L# where each L is capital.

Use the following methods to do this exercise:
str.replace(), str.isalpha(), str.isdigit(), and str.upper()

def postalValidate(S):
    """ Return False if S is not a valid postal code.
    If S is valid, return it in the format L#L#L# where each L is capital.
